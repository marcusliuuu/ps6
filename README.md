# I am using the default data set, which is a collection of sattelite data from uah, documenting various temperatures from different years and months. In the plots page, there are two widgets. One widget just changes the color palette of the scatterplot, and the widget allows the user to change the regions of the data sets. In the table page, there is one widget, where the user can select what decade they would like to view the data for.
